Communication Protocol
======================

A guide for communication within a team.

General
-------

* Prefer Github and Trello for discussions that are relevant throughout the lifetime of a project.
* What tools you use might depend on what specific project you're working on. But as a general rule, technical discussions and bugfixes belong in Github. Sprint planning, product design, feature discussions belong in Trello.
* Prefer face to face communication for more spontaneous discussions.
* Use Slack when face to face communication is not possible.
* If the discussion achieves a relevant outcome, document it on the appropriate tool for that project
* Refer to the [Github section](/github) and the [Trello](/trello) for the guidelines of those tools.

Github
------

* Open Github issues to file bug reports, and to suggest small improvements or refactors.
* Define labels and milestones in your issues, if applicable.
* Tag a person (or [team](https://github.com/orgs/groupbuddies/teams)) if you need their input specifically.
* If your Pull Requests fixes one or more issues, link to them in the discussion.
* If you're working on an issue, assign it to yourself.

Slack
-------

There is a channel for each project and event, one for
generic talk that is deemed usefull to everyone (#general), one for generic talk on
the main topics of interest of the company (Development, Design, Product Ideas, Leads, Blog Posts) and one
for random talk (#random).

* Use the channel for the project you want to talk about.
* Use the channel for the generic topic if it does not apply to a specific project.
* Avoid using private or 1-1 channels. If you're having a discussion about a
project maybe someone else can pitch in or at least read it, if not use the #random channel.
If the conversation does not fit any of the channels, question
yourself if you should be having it on the company's Slack.
* Prefer using `@channel`, which applies only to the people already on a channel.
