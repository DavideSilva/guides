Communication Protocol
======================

A guide for communication within a team.

General
-------

* Prefer face to face communication.
* Use Trello for conversations about a task that should accompany it through its
lifetime.
* Use Hipchat to communicate when the person(s) is unavailable, it is not a good
fit for trello or the discussion can be asynchronous.

Hipchat
-------

There is a room for each project, one for management (50th Floor), one for
generic talk of the company's policies (Group Buddies), one for generic talk on
the main topics of interest of the company (Development, Design, DevOps), one
for CI info (CI), one for any errors that occur on the apps (Exceptions) and one
for random talk (Danger Room).

* Use the room for the project you want to talk about.
* Use the room for the generic topic if it does not apply to a specific project.
* Avoid using private or 1-1 rooms. If you're having a discussion about a
project maybe someone else can pitch in or at least read it, if not use the
Danger Room. If the conversation does not fit any of the rooms, question
yourself if you should be having it on the company's Hipchat.
* Avoid tagging people.
* Prefer using `@all` or `@here`, which applies only to the people already on a room.
