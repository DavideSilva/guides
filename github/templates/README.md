Setup
-----

A set of instructions to install the project. It can start with a list of dependencies, like databases, and finish with the instructions, or it can be a simple list of commands. For instance:

First, clone & setup the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:subvisual/PROJECT_NAME.git
cd PROJECT_NAME
bin/setup
```

After that, open the `.env` file in your editor and fill in the required secret values.

To build the assets only once, not watching for changes, run:

```
npm run build
```

----------

Deploys can be manual or automatic. In both cases, write a short explanation about how it works: if the process is manual write the steps necessary to accomplish it; if the process is automatic, link to the page to consult the deployment status. Take the following as an example:

To deploy the app run `bin/deploy`
