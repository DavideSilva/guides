Github
======

A guide for coding socially and responsibly with Github.

General usage
-------------

* Github is not only for developers. If you're a Designer or Project Manager or even a Tester, you might be requested in a discussion
* Never mute a project's notifications. Set them to `Not watching` instead. You'll still be notified if you're explicitly tagged.
* Avoid including files in source control that are specific to your
  development machine or process.

Creating Issues
---------------

* Open Github issues to file bug reports, and to suggest small improvements or refactors.
* Define labels and milestones in your issues, if applicable. Check how other issues in that project are organized.

Working on Issues/Pull Requests
-------------------------------

* If you're working on an issue, assign it to yourself.
* Submit a Pull Request with the fix.
* If your Pull Requests fixes one or more issues, link to them in the discussion.
* Tag a person (or [team](https://github.com/orgs/subvisual/teams)) if you need their input specifically.
